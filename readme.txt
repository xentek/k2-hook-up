Be prepared to get hooked up! This plugin allows you to insert any content you want into the custom hooks added by the K2 theme. K2-RC6+ is required.

== Description ==

The K2 theme provides a number of additional hooks into the template. If youâ€™re handy with PHP you can easily add any manner of arbitrary content to these 7 regions. For everyone else, there is K2 Hook Up.

This plugin provides an options screen with each unique hook exposed as a simple text box. Insert any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript that you like, and click submit and it will be instantly published to that region of your template.

== Installation ==

1. Download the k2-hook-up.zip file, unzip and upload the whole directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Paste HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript into one of the boxes provided on the K2 Hook Up options page, and click `Update Options`
1. Revel in the glory of your customized blog!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why Would I Want This? =

If you use the K2 theme, you'll want this. This plugin will allow you to insert arbitrary content in any place you see the hooks. Great for adding javascript widgets, advertising, bits of text, and other code in places that you can't reach with just a custom CSS File or the K2 Sidebar Manager.

= Which version of K2 do I need? =

At least K2-RC6. Versions prior to this did not include the hooks necessary for this plugin to work.

= Can I paste in PHP code? =

Not yet. I plan on adding this feature in the future, but if you know PHP already, you probably don't need this plugin.
